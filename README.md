🌍 Population Analysis & Forecasting (1990-2030)

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on population analysis and forecasting from 1990 to 2030. We collected data from an unofficial web source, cleaned it, visualized it using Power BI, performed forecasting using Python, and finally created an interactive world map with GeoPandas and Folium.

📊 Data Collection & Cleaning

🔹 Data Source & Collection Process

The data was obtained from an unofficial webpage.

When downloading all required columns at once, the data became corrupted and collapsed.

To avoid this issue, each column was downloaded separately and then merged.

🔹 Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and formatted inconsistencies.

Standardized country names to ensure uniformity across different datasets.

Used Excel & Python (Pandas, NumPy) for cleaning and transformation.

📈 Data Visualization (1990-2025)

🔹 Tools Used: Power BI

Created dashboards for clear insights.

Analyzed trends in total population, birth rate, death rate, fertility rate, and immigration rate.

Identified key patterns & outliers across different years and countries.

🔮 Forecasting (2026-2030)

🔹 Tools Used: Python (Prophet, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Time-series forecasting was applied to predict population trends for 2026-2030.

Used Prophet for accurate forecasting across all countries.

Generated graphs to visualize future trends in total population, birth rate, death rate, fertility rate, and immigration rate.

🌍 Interactive Population Map

🔹 Tools Used: GeoPandas & Folium

Used GeoPandas to process geographic data.

Created an interactive world map using Folium.

Mapped the forecasted population data (2026-2030) for visualization.

Enabled tooltips & popups to show country-specific data on hover/click.

📦 Final Organization

Integrated all data & visualizations into a structured workflow.

Stored results in an organized format for easy access and analysis.

Ensured all country names matched correctly in the datasets and maps.
